    "# What are Logic Gates?\n",
    "\n",
    "Logic gates are electronic devices that perform Boolean operations.  \n",
    "They receive one or more binary inputs (0 or 1) and produce a single binary output.  \n",
    "These gates form the foundation of all digital systems, including computers, mobile devices, and other technologies.\n",

    "**Question:**  \n",
    "What are methods of real-world purpose that using logic gates can implement?  \n",
    "**Answer:**  \n",
    "Logic gates are used in real-world systems like:\n",
    "- **Authorization systems:** (AND gate) requiring keycard **AND** PIN to allow access ensures high security.\n",
    "- **Automatic doors:** (OR gate) activating if motion sensor **OR** button press detects a user, improving accessibility.\n",
    "- **Thermostats:** (NOT gate) turning systems off when reaching a temperature limit prevents overheating.\n",
    "- **Self-driving cars:** (NAND/NOR gates) combining multiple conditions like obstacle presence and speed for safe driving decisions.\n",
    "- **Memory Checking:** (XOR gate) detecting changes in stored data to prevent corruption.\n",
    "\n",
    "These impacts make systems smarter, safer, and more reliable.\n",
