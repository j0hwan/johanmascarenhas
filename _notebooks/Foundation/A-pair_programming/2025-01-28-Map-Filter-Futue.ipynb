    "**What is my Fetaure?**\n",
    "- My feature consists of an interactable map fiilter \n",
    "- the user can pick criteria based off of a perfect vacation spot \n",
    "- one criteria consists of category (historical, cultural, natural, religious, scenic, modern )\n",
    "- another criteria consists of interest tags (tags abouit the locarion ex:famous landmarks/activities)\n",
    "- They can view said vacation spot on in integrated world map\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose of My feature:**\n",
    "- The goal of my feature is to allow users to input more vacation spots to travel to\n",
    "- Doing so, users may share their own spots and update spot criteria (tags and categories)\n",
    "- others may hbe inclined to go to other spots with interesting tags\n",
    "- Users can click on tags to view location name and tags which interest them\n",
    "\n",
    "**Frontend work:**\n",
    "- I added a new area for users to input a new location\n",
    "- The user needs to first select the desired location on the map, and a Longitude and Latitude will pop up. I added a functionality where the longitude and latitude automatically get inputted in but can be edited by the user\n",
    "- Next they need to name the location and assign that named location a value, which is usually same as the location name\n",
    "- Finally they need to input the category, which there are 6 to to pick from and then assingn any interest tags. It can be literally anything as long as it is seperated by a comma.\n",
    "- I added a postt feature that adds this location to the map\n",
    "\n",
    "**Backend work:**\n",
    "- I have a *GET* request to retrieve all sumbitted locations\n",
    "- I have a *POST* request to post new locations and assign filters to that location\n",
    "- I gave a *DELETE* request to delete the location\n",
