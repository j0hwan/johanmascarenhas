    "Hack #2 An MIT liscence is a permissive open source liscence that allows users to use and copy the structure and sell/ use it for their own benefit. The caviat is that you have to give credit by stating the liscence in the code/ site/ project. However, there are some certain regulations. In a personal project I could use the format of a code form MIT and give credit to MIT using the MIT liscence.\n",

It allows others to freely use, modify, and distribute my code, even in proprietary software, as long as they include the original copyright notice. This flexibility encourages collaboration and reuse, making it ideal for a personal project I want to share and grow. It benefits users by not placing heavy restrictions on how they use or build upon my code.\n",
