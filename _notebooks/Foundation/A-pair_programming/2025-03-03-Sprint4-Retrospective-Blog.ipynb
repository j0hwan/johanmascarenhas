    "My future in Comp sci\n",
    "I chose to take this class because I wanted to expand my understanding of computer science—it seemed like a practical elective, especially as I prepare for college. From the very first lesson, I realized that computer science is so much more than just coding. We explored algorithms, problem-solving strategies, and the core principles that power today’s technology.\n",
    "\n",
    "This course has opened up opportunities I never expected. I’ve developed critical thinking skills, learned to collaborate effectively through group projects, and gained a structured approach to tackling complex problems. These skills will be invaluable as I continue studying computer science in college.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, learning and applying Agile and Scrum methodologies has given me a strong foundation for college-level coursework. Hearing from computer science students about how AP CSP helped them succeed in college made me appreciate the value of this class even more. Now, I feel confident that the knowledge I’ve gained will serve me well in my future studies."
