    "Problem: AI algorithms used in predictive policing.\n",
    " Risk: These systems may target certain communities unfairly based on biased historical data, increasing discrimination and unjust policing.\n",
    "Solution 1: Train AI on diverse, unbiased data sets and remove historical patterns of discrimination.\n",
    " Solution 2: Implement human oversight panels to audit AI predictions and outcomes regularly.\n",
    "Reflection: Ethical AI development is crucial because technology affects real people’s lives. If we don’t consider fairness and accountability, AI could make existing social problems worse. Responsible coding helps make AI trustworthy and equitable.\n",

    "AI Example: Amazon’s AI recruiting tool.\n",
    " What Happened: Amazon developed an AI to help with hiring by scanning resumes. However, it began to favor male candidates over female ones, reflecting historical gender bias in tech hiring.\n",
    "Response: Amazon scrapped the tool after discovering the bias.\n",
    "Prevention: Developers could have used balanced datasets and tested the tool for bias before deployment. Regular audits and diverse teams in development would also help avoid such issues.\n",
