    "Modern operating systems and browsers cannot always detect infinite loops because it's an undecidable problem, but they use practical tools to manage them. For example, browsers like Chrome show an error message like “Page Unresponsive” if a script runs too long, and give users the option to stop it. Operating systems use task managers or activity monitors to detect when a program is using too much CPU or memory, allowing users to force quit it. These systems rely on timeouts, resource limits, and user input to handle problems that can’t be solved automatically, helping prevent crashes or freezes.\n"
