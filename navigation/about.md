Creator of Student 2025 - i skibidi on the daily

# My journey starts here. 
I, Johan mascarenhas, am a junior attending the school Del Norte...
As a junior i decided to take AP computer science principals because of my interest in computers and coding. I took a couple courses ralting to html, css, and java whenh I was younger to develop a familiarity with various coing languages.  

## A little more about me as a person:

am a strong believer of inspiratonal quotes. 
I think that inspirational quotes can provide many people with the nesessary motivations to exceed in life.
Fortnite is a battle royale game in which people battle to the death (online) in teams of 2, 3, or 4 or by themselves in a lobby of ~100 people. Fortnite is a very exceptional and frequently updated game created by the famous gaming company *epic games*.
I decided to indulge myself into  more fortnite quotes because it combines two of the most crucial asects of my life... Fortnite Battle Royale, and inspirational quotes.

<a href="https://www.fortnite.com/?lang=en-US" target= "_blank">where i get most of my inspiration from!</a>


Lets delve into the first inspirational fortnite quote...                                              
**"There are many floppers in the sea"**                                            
incoming explanation! :floppers ae digital fish in the hit game fortnite battle royale. These fish can be fished out using the in-game fishing rod. This quote can suggest that fishing out one flopper shouldnt be the onl floppper you should chase after. Depending on context this could also mean that if you have trouble finding the best thing/person (flopper) it is  not the end of the world. This quote did get some inspiration from the quote "There are many fish in the sea" but replaces the fish with Floppers.

The second quote that I had to add to this blog was...                  
**"The smaller the circle is the better youre doing" -Wyatt Zimmer**

Watch out for this Second Incoming explanation!:
This quote was masterfully said by a very wise and small indivudual, Wyatt Zimmer. This quote to me means that the longer you last in a competition, the stronger the opponents get, thus leading to the conclusion that your doing great.
